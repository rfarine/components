### Prettier

To enforce a standard code style, a üê∂ [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) pre-commit hook runs [Lint-Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically format our code using ‚ú® [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html).

## Usage

### Normalize

If you want everything to appear correctly in all browsers, make sure to include our Normalize.css file at the root of your project:

```
import '@thewing/components/dist/css/normalize.css';
```

### Theme

To use our theme, just import it and use it in a `ThemeProvider`:

```
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import '@thewing/components/dist/theme';

  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    [...]
  </ThemeProvider>
```

### Fonts

To enable our fonts in your project, just include the sass file either in your index JS or in the `<head>` of your index HTML. You'll also need to import the fonts (either by hosting them yourself or adding the folder `node_modules/@thewing/components/dist/assets/fonts` as a part of your build step.)

`import '@thewing/components/dist/css/fonts.css'`
